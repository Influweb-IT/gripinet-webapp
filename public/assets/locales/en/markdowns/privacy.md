## 1. Data controller and data processor

The University of Tartu (registry code 74001073, address Ülikooli 18, 50090 Tartu, e-mail info@ut.ee) is the controller of the personal data of the study.

The processor of the study is the Fondazione Istituto per l’Interscambio Scientifico - I.S.I. Turin (Italy), Via Chisola n. 5.

## 2. Purpose of data processing

The aim of the study is to monitor and analyze the occurrence and dynamics of flu and flu-like symptoms. 
In addition, identify symptoms that may indicate the presence of respiratory diseases, such as influenza 
and SARS-CoV-2. Monitoring the increase or decrease in the number of symptomatic individuals over time is an important indicator of public health.

## 3. Study duration

November 1, 2024 to October 2025.

## 4. Legal basis for personal data processing

The legal basis for the processing of personal data is the informed written consent of the research
participants.

## 5. What data is collected and processed within the scope of the study?

The personal data collected and processed during the study are your contact data, IP address and
data that include information about your general health and state of health:

1. E-mail address, first and last name
2. Password to enter the Gripiradar platform
3. Background data (for example, age, date of birth, age, zip code of residence, gender,
professional status, education, etc.), employment of children in school/kindergarten
4. Your previously diagnosed chronic diseases and allergies, including when your flu-like
symptoms appeared
5. History of vaccination against pathogens of respiratory infections
6. Data about pregnancy.

The technical data of the device (computer/smart device) contacting your website is stored only
in the log data. Log data is collected for the purpose of infrastructure monitoring and quick
resolution of technical errors.

## 6. How do the researchers process my personal data?

Data are obtained from three questionnaires completed by participants in an online survey.
Through the questionnaires&#39;, personalized data is collected and the researcher in charge of the
study has access to them. Before the start of the Data Analysis, the responsible researcher makes
the personalized data pseudonymous, and thus the University of Tartu researchers conducting the
study have access only to data that does not enable the direct identification of individuals.

Joining the study is online on the Gripiradar platform of the University of Tartu. Through the
questionnaire, data is collected on the University of Tartu server, which the responsible
researcher and infrastructure administrators have access to within the scope of their duties.

## 7. What happens to the information collected about me during the survey?

Participation in the study means that your personal data

- is collected as part of the study
- the researchers analyze them anonymously
- after the analysis is completed, the pseudonymised data will be converted into
anonymous data.

The researchers and the data processor may use personal data that is personalized in the
collection phase and pseudonymized in the analysis phase for scientific purposes only.

Only project members who are aware of the study&#39;s objectives will be included. Persons outside
the study group cannot access the data.

### 7.1. Data protection risks

We have prepared an impact assessment for the organization of the study, and within this
framework we have assessed the risks regarding the processing of the researched health data and
implemented the necessary measures for secure data processing.

## 8. How is my data processed?

Your data is collected and processed by the researchers of the University of Tartu. Data
processing takes place on the infrastructure of the Center for Scientific Computing of the
University of Tartu.

We have the right to process your personal data in accordance with the purpose of conducting
the research and on the basis of your informing and agreeing to the informed consent form.

## 9. Do I have access and the possibility to correct the data collected and processed about me as part of the study?

You have the right to ask the researchers what data about you has been collected and what they
are used for in the study. Responsible researchers: Professor Irja Lutsar irja.lutsar@ut.ee and
Associate Professor Kristi Huik kristi.huik@ut.ee
You are entitled to:

- access and check your data that you have provided us with the questionnaire,
- ask to delete all your data until the destruction of personal data on 31.10.2026,
- request correction of your incorrect data,
- object to the processing of your personal data,
- withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data. From the moment you withdraw your consent, your personal data will be deleted from the study data and thus made anonymous.

## 10. What happens to the survey results?

The results of the survey are regularly published in an impersonal form on the Gripiradar website
[https://gripiradar.ut.ee](https://gripiradar.ut.ee). Later, the results obtained during the study and the description of
the study will be published in medical journals. A copy of the research publication resulting from
the study is published on the website and is also available from the investigators or staff involved
in the study.

These websites and published articles do not include information that would enable your identity
to be identified.

## 11. Will my data be used for purposes other than those mentioned in the study I am participating in?

The anonymized results of the study are used only to answer the scientific questions raised
within the study. All additional studies or studies to be conducted in the future must be approved
by the Estonian Ethics Committee.

## 12. How long will my data be stored?
Personal data (contact data, logs of IP addresses) will be stored until 31.10.2026. Preservation of
personal data during the necessary data cleaning and error correction phase, as they may also
appear in the data entered at the end of the project. For this purpose, it may be necessary to re-
identify the data. The code key is stored for 1 year after the end of the study, i.e. until
31.10.2026.

After the end of the study, anonymized data will be stored for at least 25 years in order to
perform more precise analyzes (based on age or geographical distribution) and the dynamics of
corresponding changes in the future. This is needed when real-time changes are seen (new,
mutated, new, old respiratory virus) and changes over time in the country are registered. It is
known that influenza epidemics are periodic and may occur and indicate changes in the virus,
and as a result, different measures can be implemented as needed.

## 13. Changes in data protection conditions

The data protection conditions may be changed if something changes in data processing. If this
happens, we will publish the revised data protection terms, contact you and ask you again for
your consent in this regard before starting data processing.
