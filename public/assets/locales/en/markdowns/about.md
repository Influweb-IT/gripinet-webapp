## Overview of the study

The research platform Gripiradar collects and processes personal data in accordance with the legal basis
and the General Regulation on the Protection of Personal Data. The research project is financed by
European Union VERDI project (SARS-CoV-2 variants Evaluation in pRegnancy and paeDIatrics cohorts).
The research has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Tartu.

By sharing your data as part of this study, you are directly contributing to research that focuses on the
study of the spread of respiratory infectious diseases, including the new coronavirus. If you express your
desire to participate in the study, you will be invited by e-mail each week to answer a questionnaire that
collects information about recently experienced symptoms (such as fever or cough) that could indicate
the presence of an infectious disease. This platform has been set up in collaboration with InfluenzaNet.
InfluenzaNet is the collective name of a cooperation project between several European universities and
governments. An overview of the InfluenzaNet project, the participating countries and the analysis of
the collected data can be found on the page [https://influenzanet.info](https://influenzanet.info). This study platform is the
Estonian application of this scientific study.

Participation in the study is voluntary. We would like to emphasize that the completed questionnaires
and the information displayed on the website and the use of the website have no medical significance
for you. You should always seek medical care if you have health problems. You are requested to fill out
the questionnaires until May 2026.

#### Why do we need Gripiradar?

We know that many people who become infected with upper respiratory
infections, such as the flu and the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, have mild or moderate symptoms and thus, do
not go to the doctor. Also, not everyone experiencing symptoms of respiratory infections does not get
tested. This makes it difficult to track the spread of above-mentioned infections in Estonia. However, the
monitoring of symptoms that are not reported to a doctor is important from the viewpoint of public
health and disease outbreaks.

#### Who can participate? 

Anyone living in Estonia who is 18 years or older can participate in the study on a
voluntary basis. To ensure that information about the spread of infectious diseases is also obtained for
children and young people, the parents or legal guardians of a minor can also complete the
questionnaires on behalf of the child. This is not mandatory, but it will contribute to the research.
If the participant has any questions regarding the rights of the subject, please contact the Human
Research Ethics Committee of the University of Tartu by e-mail at eetikakomitee@ut.ee or phone 737
6215. With complaints regarding the processing of personal data, please contact the Data Protection
Inspectorate at phone 5620 2341.

#### How does Gripiradar work?

Before creating an account on the platform, the subject or legal
representative of the subject familiarizes himself with the brief description of the study and the data
protection conditions and agrees to the information and informed consent form. Participants who have
created an account on the platform will receive an initial registration form with questions about their
background, age, gender, and existing diseases and conditions. Filling the admission questionnaire takes
5-10 minutes and the vaccination questionnaire can be answered in 10-15 minutes. Following this the
study participants will receive an email every week with a link to a questionnaire asking about the
changes in their health / what symptoms they have had in the past week. The questionnaire must be
completed even if the participant has no symptoms. If the participant has no symptoms the completion
of the questionnaire takes less than one minute, and about 3 to 5 minutes if the participant has
symptoms. The completion of the questionnaire enables the researchers to monitor how certain
symptoms are distributed and changes in these patterns over time in Estonia. In the future, the research
conducted based on collected data from this study will also be useful for other viruses and infectious
diseases. Detailed information about the survey data and participation can be found [here](/survey-data).
