**Informed consent**

By clicking the "I consent" button, you agree to participate in the
influenzanet survey and accept that your data will be processed for this
survey.

The survey aims to identify symptoms that may indicate the presence of
respiratory infectious diseases, e.g., influenza, the new coronavirus.
Determining whether the number of people with symptoms is increasing or
decreasing is important from the population health viewpoint. More
information about the purpose of the survey and your rights can be found
in the [privacy policy](/privacy).

-   For consent granted on behalf of a minor, the following applies in
    addition to the foregoing conditions:

        declare that I am legally authorised to grant consent as a
        parent or guardian.
